Hi! I'm Jesse! I'm a programmer from Melbourne, Australia. I love anything to do with embedded systems or 3D Graphics (or a combination of the
two! GPUS are fun!), or anything computer related. I work as an embedded systems programmer at [Analog Devices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog_Devices).

I work on a few cool projects, some with some really _really_ smart people from around the world. Here are some projects that you might like:

[SerenityOS](github.com/SerenityOS/serenity): A FOSS UNIX-like Operating System with a plethora of custom tools, programs and features. This project is lead by the briljant [Andreas Kling](https://github.com/awesomekling). His twitter is [here](https://twitter.com/awesomekling). I've been working on Serenity for quite some time now, and worked on creating a few cool libraries and Kernel features, such as an OpenGL 1.5 compatible library and a small USB stack and host controller driver (though I'm not the _only_ person that works on these) 

[Rush3D](https://github.com/Quaker762/DE10-GPU): A Verilog based Graphics Processing Unit with a custom OpenGL 1.1 compliant `libgl` library. This one was my capstone project at University!


### Contact me
You can reach me @ [jesse.buhagiar@serenityos.org](mailto:jesse.buhagiar@serenityos.org). I also (used to) hang out on `#serenityos` (freenode IRC) as `quaker`, however I'm not mostly found on the SerenityOS Discord Server in #opengl or #usb (two parts of the project that I """own""" (i.e mostly work on)).
