Hi! I'm Jesse! I'm a programmer from Melbourne, Australia. I love anything to do with embedded systems or 3D Graphics (or a combination of the
two! GPUS are fun!), or anything computer related. 

I work on a few cool projects, some with some really _really_ smart people from around the world. Here are some projects that you might like:

[SerenityOS](github.com/SerenityOS/serenity): A FOSS UNIX-like Operating System with a plethora of custom tools, programs and features. This project is lead by the briljant [Andreas Kling](github.com/awesomekling). His twitter is [here](https://twitter.com/awesomekling). 

[Rush3D](github.com/Quaker762/https://github.com/Quaker762/DE10-GPU): A Verilog based Graphics Processing Unit with a custom OpenGL 1.1 compliant `libgl` library. This one was my capstone project at University!
